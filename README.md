This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset. The dataset includes weather data and fire-related indices from two regions in Algeria, collected between June and September 2012. By analyzing features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other FWI components, the model aims to accurately predict FWI, aiding in forest fire risk management and prevention strategies.
